        <div class='step'>What is it?</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>Nightcode is the only thing you need to create Clojure and Java projects for the command line, the desktop, the web, and Android -- besides JDK 6 or above. Whether you choose to make a Clojure or pure Java project, Nightcode will use its built-in copy of Leiningen to build and run your code.

        <div class='step'>Built-in templates</div>
        <img src='templates.png' class='small-screenshot' />
        <div>After hitting New Project and giving it a name, you'll be presented with eight ready-made templates. You can make a console program, a <a href='http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/'>LibGDX</a> game, and an Android app in either Clojure or Java. The game projects will compile for <i>both</i> Android and desktop from the same codebase! Additionally, there is a template for making a Clojure desktop program using the <a href='https://github.com/daveray/seesaw'>seesaw</a> library, and for making a web app in ClojureScript.</div>

        <div class='step'>Keyboard friendly</div>
        <img src='hints.png' class='small-screenshot' />
        <div>Hold down the control key (or command on OS X), and you'll see shortcut hints appear over every applicable widget. Holding it while pressing up/down/enter will move your selection in the project tree and expand/collapse directories. Holding it while pressing left/right will move between recent files, much like tabs in other IDEs but without the UI clutter. Lastly, <a href='http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.html'>paredit mode</a> can be toggled for Clojure and ClojureScript files via a button above the editor.</div>

        <div class='step'>Clojure integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>The REPL pane on the bottom-left is a convenient scratchpad to try out Clojure commands. The build pane on the bottom-right gives you access to all the Leiningen commands to run, build, and test your project. Additionally, Clojure files have a 'Doc' button above the editor, which will provide completion suggestions for whatever you're typing thanks to the integrated <a href='https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment'>compliment</a> library.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>ClojureScript integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>Due to the integrated <a href='https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild'>lein-cljsbuild</a> plugin, building ClojureScript projects is supported. Using the provided template, you can build a complete web app using Clojure on the server side and ClojureScript on the client side -- all inside the same project. You'll even find an 'Auto' button in the build pane, which runs lein-cljsbuild's auto rebuild feature so your ClojureScript files rebuild every time you save them.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>Android integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>Due to the integrated <a href='https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid'>lein-droid</a> plugin, building Android projects is supported. The "Run" button builds and installs your app on your connected device. The "Build" button creates a release version of the app and lets you sign it. In addition, Android projects have a special "LogCat" item in the sidebar, which will show your device's or emulator's logs.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>Java integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>Nightcode works with pure Java projects as well, including standard Android projects. You can start one with one of the built-in templates, or you can import one and it will prompt you to create a project.clj file. You'll need to edit it a little bit so the Leiningen knows how to build the project. For non-Android Java projects, you'll get to use the Reload button, which will let you automatically inject newly-saved changes into your running program via Java's HotSwap feature.</div>
