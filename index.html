        <div class='step'>What is it?</div>
    	<div class='sectionbody'>Nightcode is the only thing you need to create Clojure and Java projects for the command line, the desktop, the web, and Android -- besides JDK 6 or above. Whether you choose to make a Clojure or pure Java project, Nightcode will use its built-in copy of Leiningen to build and run your code.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>Built-in templates</div>
	<img src='templates.png' class='small-screenshot' />
        <div>You can easily start a console or Android project in either language. Additionally, for Clojure, you can start a desktop project that uses the excellent seesaw library, and a web project to get started with ClojureScript. Lastly, for Java, you can start a simple or advanced game project, which creates a mini2Dx or LibGDX project respectively, which can be compiled for either the desktop or Android.</div>
    </div>

        <div class='step'>Keyboard friendly</div>
	<img src='hints.png' class='small-screenshot' />
        <div>Hold down the control key, and you'll see shortcut hints appear over every applicable widget. Pressing control + up/down/enter will move your selection in the project tree and expand/collapse directories.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>Clojure integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>The REPL pane on the bottom-left is a convenient scratchpad to try out Clojure commands. The build pane on the bottom-right gives you access to all the important Leiningen commands to run, build, and test your project. This makes Nightcode the easiest way to get started with Clojure.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>Java integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>Nightcode works with pure Java projects as well, including standard Android projects. You can start one with one of the built-in templates, or you can import one and it will prompt you to create a project.clj file. You'll need to edit it a little bit so the Leiningen knows how to build the project. You may find that it's a much nicer build system than whatever you were using before.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>Android integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>For Android projects, the "Run" button builds and installs your app on your connected device. The "Build" button creates a release version of the app and lets you sign it. In addition, Android projects have a special "LogCat" item in the sidebar, which will show your device's or emulator's logs.</div>
